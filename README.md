# GAIA Components Library

A collection of production-ready UI components designed specifically for building AI assistants and chatbots. These are the components we use at GAIA, now available for anyone building conversational interfaces.

## Why This Library?

Building a great chat or assistant interface requires more than just generic UI components. We've spent countless hours refining these components to handle the unique challenges of conversational UIs.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, use the same battle-tested components that power GAIA.

## Getting Started

All components are compatible with the `shadcn` CLI, making installation effortless:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.heygaia.io
```

Or add individual components:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.heygaia.io/r/raised-button.json
```

## Built With

- **Next.js** - For the documentation and registry
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - For styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Radix UI** - For accessible primitives

## Contributing

Found a bug or have an idea for a new component? We'd love your contributions! This library is open source and built for the community.
